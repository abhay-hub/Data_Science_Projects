### This repository contains some of the Data Science Projects that I have worked on and practiced my skills.
- ### [Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/abhay-hub/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/Housing_price_prediction.ipynb) - Regression Problem 
   - House Prices are very dynamics and owning a dream house is life goal of many people out there. In this notebook, prices of the houses were identified by training our model on the training data set and testing it on test dataset. I performed Data preprocessinng and Data manipulation on the data and applied Random Forest to accurately predict the price of the house.
   
      - Technique used are ___Python, RandomForest, Data Pre-processing, Data manipulation, Data Visualization___.


- ### [Heart Disease Classification](https://github.com/abhay-hub/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/heart-data-uci.ipynb) - Classification problem
   - This data consist of data related to heart disease and task in hand is to accurately identify if a person has a heart disease or not. Here I compared different __Machine Learning__ techniques and checked their accuracy score.
   
      - Technique used are ___Python, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) , RandomForest (RF), Decision Tree, Neural Network (ANN), Data Pre-processing, Data manipulation, Outlier Detection,Data Visualization___.


- ### [Breast Cancer Classification](https://github.com/abhay-hub/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/Breast_cancer.ipynb) - Classification problem
   - This data consist of data related to Breast Cancer and task in hand is to accurately identify the type of tumor ( Benign or Malignant) in a person.  Here I used Artificial Neural Network and checked the accuracy score.
   
      - Technique used are ___R, Neural Network (ANN), Data Pre-processing, Data manipulation, Data Visualization___.


- ### [Spam Detection]
