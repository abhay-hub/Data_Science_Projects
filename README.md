   - Prices of the house are very dynamics and owning a dream house is life goal of many people out there. In this notebook prices of the houses were identified by training our model on the training data set and testing it on test dataset. I performed Data preprocessinng and Data manipulation on the data and applied Random Forest to accurately predict the price of the house.
